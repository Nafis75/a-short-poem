My poem

Roses are red,
so is your head,
But that's not the case usually...

Violets are blue,
And I thought so too,
But your boiled blood made it too much creepy...

Now this is the time
to ring the chime
to release the bees and hornets

Now this is the time 
to be completely fine
to listen to nightly crickets
